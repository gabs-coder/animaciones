    <!--As another UX tip, many of the CSS properties are heavy for the engine to process such as height, width or background-color. However
    you can instead of using those heavy properties when animating your page, use the easy and not-so-heavy properties. They are 
    for example: transform and opacity.

    You would rather use them when animating instead of the heavy properties and you can surely accomplish the same 
    purpose you wanted to accomplish, but even much easier.
